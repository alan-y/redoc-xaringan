R Markdown
----------

This is an [R Markdown]{.deletion author="alanye01"
date="2019-03-04T21:49:00Z"}[redoc]{.insertion author="alanye01"
date="2019-03-04T21:49:00Z"} document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax
for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R
Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes
both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the
document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

Including Plots
---------------

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent
printing of the R code that generated the plot.
